# Pedistrian-Detection-Model

Developed an AI-based pedestrian detection model 
using deep learning techniques, specifically TensorFlow, to enable real-time pedestrian 
detection in surveillance systems. Achieved 90% accuracy and optimized the modelâ€™s 
performance for fast inference using Open-CV for real-time processing.
